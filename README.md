## Techstacks used 
`nodejs` , `react` 

## How to run locally 
Certainly! Here's a simplified outline for creating a basic women's rights app using Node.js for the backend and React for the frontend:

1. **Setup and Installation:**
   - Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
   - Create a new project directory for your app.

2. **Backend Development (Node.js):**
   - Initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init`.
   - Install necessary packages like Express.js for building the server, and any other dependencies you may need.
   - Set up routes to handle API requests related to women's rights topics.
   - Connect to a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) if you need to store and retrieve data.
   - Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations if necessary.

3. **Frontend Development (React):**
   - Initialize a new React app using `npx create-react-app`.
   - Structure your app components, such as search bar, informational pages, and user interface elements.
   - Use React Router for navigation between different pages or components.
   - Make API calls to your backend server to fetch data related to women's rights topics.
   - Display retrieved data in your React components.

4. **Integration:**
   - Connect your frontend React app to the backend Node.js server using API endpoints.
   - Ensure proper CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration to allow communication between frontend and backend.
   - Test the integration thoroughly to ensure data is being fetched and displayed correctly.

5. **Styling and UI/UX:**
   - Add CSS styles or utilize libraries like Bootstrap or Material-UI for styling your app.
   - Focus on creating a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and visually appealing.



# What's next ?
The future scope of the women's rights app includes expanding features, customizing content for diverse regions, forming partnerships, integrating emerging technologies, advocating for policy changes, building communities, enhancing education and capacity-building efforts, and scaling up global reach. Through these avenues, the app will continue to empower women, foster advocacy, and drive positive change worldwide.
